# Web-Scraper

This repo contains two Web Scraper scripts for ([Fake Python](https://realpython.github.io/fake-jobs/) and [Free Python Job Board](https://pythonjobs.github.io/)) websites. The already completed script wrangles through Fake Python jobs as found [*here*](https://github.com/aurimas13/Web-Scraper/blob/main/scrape_jobs.py) while I am still developing a script to wrangle the Free Python Job Board posts as found [*here*](https://github.com/aurimas13/Web-Scraper/blob/main/scrape_jobs_free_python.py).
